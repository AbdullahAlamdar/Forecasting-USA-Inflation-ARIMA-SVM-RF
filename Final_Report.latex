\textbf{Prediction of USA' Inflation Using ML Models}

ARIMA , SVM , Random Forest




\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Inflation forecasting plays a pivotal role in economic planning, policy
formulation, and decision-making. It refers to the process of predicting
the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services
rises, eroding the purchasing power of money. Accurate inflation
forecasts are crucial for governments, businesses, and financial
institutions as they influence a wide range of economic decisions,
including interest rates, wages, tax policies, and investment
strategies. Over the years, various models and methods have been
developed to predict inflation, utilizing a range of data sources, from
macroeconomic indicators to market expectations.

\hypertarget{context-and-importance-of-inflation-forecasting}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Context and Importance of Inflation
Forecasting:}}{Context and Importance of Inflation Forecasting:}}\label{context-and-importance-of-inflation-forecasting}}

Inflation has significant economic implications. It directly impacts the
purchasing power of consumers, affecting everything from household
savings to the cost of living. For governments and central banks,
managing inflation is a core economic objective. High inflation can lead
to reduced consumer confidence, economic instability, and a decline in
real incomes, while low inflation or deflation can signal weak demand
and an economic slowdown. Hence, accurate forecasting of inflation
becomes vital to ensure that policy interventions can be timely and
effective.

Inflation forecasting is a complex task due to the many factors
influencing price changes. These include demand and supply dynamics,
labor market conditions, global economic factors, and fiscal policies.
Moreover, inflation is inherently a lagging indicator, meaning it
reflects past trends and conditions, making its forecasting even more
challenging. Despite these challenges, inflation prediction is essential
to maintain economic stability, as governments and central banks adjust
their monetary policies based on forecasted inflation trends.

\hypertarget{historical-context}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Historical
Context:}}{Historical Context:}}\label{historical-context}}

The history of inflation forecasting dates back to the early 20th
century when economists began recognizing the importance of anticipating
price movements. Early approaches focused on simple statistical models
that relied heavily on historical data. The simplest of these models,
such as univariate time series models, relied solely on past inflation
rates to predict future values. However, such models were limited in
their accuracy, particularly during periods of significant economic
change or external shocks.

The evolution of inflation forecasting models accelerated with the rise
of macroeconomic theory and econometric techniques in the mid-20th
century. Economists like Phillips and Keynesian scholars emphasized the
relationship between inflation and unemployment, leading to the
development of the Phillips Curve, which suggested that inflation could
be managed through government fiscal and monetary policies. During this
period, econometric models gained prominence as policymakers sought to
understand the effects of monetary policies on inflation.

By the 1970s and 1980s, with the rise of globalization and increasing
complexity in the global economy, traditional models became less
effective. The 1973 oil crisis, for example, demonstrated that
supply-side shocks could significantly alter inflationary trends,
prompting economists to rethink the assumptions of many forecasting
models. Newer approaches, such as structural macroeconomic models, began
to incorporate more variables and detailed data sets to better capture
the complexities of inflation dynamics.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the increased availability of
high-frequency economic data, coupled with advancements in computational
power, paved the way for more sophisticated models. Central banks,
including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, began using
a combination of various econometric and statistical models to forecast
inflation more effectively. These methods allowed policymakers to refine
their inflation-targeting strategies, making their interventions more
precise and timely.

\hypertarget{science-behind-inflation-forecasting}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Science Behind Inflation
Forecasting:}}{Science Behind Inflation Forecasting:}}\label{science-behind-inflation-forecasting}}

Inflation forecasting models can be broadly classified into two
categories: \textbf{structural models} and \textbf{time-series models}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Structural Models:\\
  } Structural models, such as the New Keynesian model, aim to explain
  inflation based on underlying economic principles. These models
  incorporate relationships between various economic variables such as
  output, unemployment, interest rates, and wages. Structural models
  typically rely on economic theory to explain the channels through
  which different factors influence inflation. For example, the output
  gap---defined as the difference between actual and potential
  output---plays a significant role in predicting inflation. When the
  economy is operating above its potential (i.e., when there is high
  demand for goods and services), inflation tends to rise.
\item
  \textbf{Time-Series Models:\\
  } Time-series models, on the other hand, rely purely on historical
  data to predict future inflation. The most common time-series models
  include \textbf{Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)}
  models, which capture the temporal dependencies in the inflation data.
  These models assume that future inflation can be predicted based on
  past inflation trends, with no explicit need to consider the
  underlying economic causes. However, time-series models can often be
  improved by including external variables, such as oil prices, exchange
  rates, and labor market indicators.
\end{enumerate}

Over time, economists have combined elements of both approaches, leading
to the development of \textbf{mixed-frequency models} and
\textbf{forecast combination techniques}. These models incorporate
multiple sources of data, such as expert judgment, macroeconomic
variables, and combinations of various forecasting models, in an effort
to improve accuracy. Additionally, machine learning techniques, such as
\textbf{Support Vector Machines (SVMs)} and \textbf{Random Forest
models}, have recently been applied to inflation forecasting, providing
more advanced methods for capturing complex, nonlinear relationships in
data.

\hypertarget{reason-for-choosing-the-topic}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Reason for Choosing the
Topic:}}{Reason for Choosing the Topic:}}\label{reason-for-choosing-the-topic}}

The motivation for choosing the topic of inflation forecasting stems
from its central importance in economic policymaking and financial
planning. As the world continues to experience rapid economic
transformations---driven by factors such as globalization, technological
advancements, and climate change---the ability to predict inflation
becomes even more critical. Traditional models, while valuable, often
fail to account for the complexities introduced by global
interconnectedness and unforeseen shocks. This has prompted a renewed
interest in developing more robust, adaptive forecasting methods that
can incorporate a wider range of variables and data sources.

The recent global economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic
and subsequent supply chain challenges, have further underscored the
need for more accurate inflation predictions. The pandemic, for example,
led to both supply-side and demand-side shocks that were difficult to
predict using traditional forecasting models. Therefore, this research
aims to contribute to the field of inflation forecasting by exploring
advanced methodologies, including the use of machine learning techniques
and forecast combinations, to enhance prediction accuracy. By
incorporating a broader array of data sources and employing cutting-edge
statistical methods, this study aims to improve our understanding of
inflation dynamics and assist policymakers in making more informed
decisions.

In conclusion, inflation forecasting remains a critical area of study
due to its far-reaching implications for economic stability and policy
effectiveness. As economies continue to face new challenges and
uncertainties, the ability to predict inflation with greater accuracy
will be essential for governments and financial institutions alike. This
report, therefore, aims to investigate the current state of inflation
forecasting, assess the effectiveness of various methodologies, and
contribute new insights into how forecasting can be improved to meet the
demands of the modern economic landscape.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Literature
Review}}{Literature Review}}\label{literature-review}}

\textbf{Purpose of The Literature Review}

The purpose of this literature review is to explore existing research
and methodologies related to inflation forecasting, with a particular
focus on the United States. In this review, we aim to analyze the
strengths, weaknesses, and applications of various forecasting
techniques, including traditional time series models such as ARIMA
(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and machine learning models
like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest. By understanding
the methodologies utilized in past studies, this review seeks to provide
a foundation for selecting the most effective forecasting techniques and
highlight gaps in current research that this project intends to address.

\hypertarget{contextualization}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Contextualization}}{Contextualization}}\label{contextualization}}

Inflation forecasting is a critical component of economic analysis, as
it provides policymakers, businesses, and investors with valuable
insights into future price trends. Accurate inflation predictions are
essential for making informed decisions regarding monetary policy,
interest rates, wage adjustments, and long-term investment planning. In
developed countries like the USA, inflation forecasting plays a pivotal
role in shaping the broader economic landscape. Given the complexity and
volatility of inflationary pressures---often influenced by domestic and
international factors---having reliable forecasting models can help
mitigate economic risks and guide the formulation of effective policy
responses. Moreover, inflation forecasts allow central banks, such as
the Federal Reserve, to implement targeted measures to control inflation
and ensure stable economic growth.

\hypertarget{scope-of-the-review}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Scope of the
Review}}{Scope of the Review}}\label{scope-of-the-review}}

This literature review will cover the application of various inflation
forecasting techniques, focusing on both traditional and modern methods.
The primary models under review will include ARIMA, which is widely used
for time series forecasting due to its ability to model trends and
seasonality in inflation data. Additionally, the review will discuss
machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
Random Forest, which have gained popularity in recent years for their
capacity to handle large datasets and capture complex, non-linear
relationships in economic data. The effectiveness of these models will
be evaluated based on their ability to predict inflation in the context
of the USA, with comparisons drawn from empirical studies that have
applied these methods to similar macroeconomic forecasting tasks.
Finally, the review will discuss the advantages and limitations of these
methods, including considerations of model accuracy, computational
complexity, and the potential for overfitting. This review aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of inflation
forecasting research, identifying key methodologies and highlighting
areas for further exploration.

\hypertarget{theoretical-background-on-inflation-and-economic-forecasting}{%
\subsubsection{Theoretical Background on Inflation and Economic
Forecasting}\label{theoretical-background-on-inflation-and-economic-forecasting}}

\hypertarget{inflation-definition}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Inflation
Definition}}{Inflation Definition}}\label{inflation-definition}}

Inflation refers to the general increase in the price level of goods and
services over time, resulting in a decrease in the purchasing power of a
currency. It is typically measured as the percentage change in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other price indices over a specific
period, such as monthly or annually. Inflation can be categorized into
two types: \textbf{demand-pull inflation}, which occurs when demand for
goods and services exceeds their supply, and \textbf{cost-push
inflation}, which arises when the cost of production increases (e.g.,
due to rising wages or raw material prices). A moderate level of
inflation is often considered necessary for economic growth, but when
inflation becomes too high or too volatile, it can lead to economic
instability.

In developed economies like the USA, inflation is closely monitored and
controlled due to its potential to impact multiple aspects of the
economy. High inflation can erode consumer purchasing power, disrupt
savings, and lead to uncertainty in investment decisions. On the other
hand, deflation---where prices fall across the economy---can lead to
reduced economic activity, higher unemployment, and potentially a
recession. Therefore, central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the
USA, aim to maintain inflation at a target rate (usually around 2\%) to
ensure stable economic conditions, foster growth, and protect the value
of the currency.

\hypertarget{inflation-forecasting}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Inflation
Forecasting}}{Inflation Forecasting}}\label{inflation-forecasting}}

Inflation forecasting is a crucial tool for central banks, policymakers,
and financial analysts. By accurately predicting future inflation rates,
these stakeholders can take preemptive actions to stabilize the economy,
adjust interest rates, and formulate appropriate fiscal and monetary
policies. Effective inflation forecasting helps mitigate the risk of
inflationary or deflationary spirals, enabling governments to maintain
control over economic variables such as employment, wages, and prices.

There are various methods for forecasting inflation, ranging from
traditional econometric models to advanced machine learning techniques.
\textbf{Econometric models}, such as \textbf{ARIMA} (AutoRegressive
Integrated Moving Average) and \textbf{VAR} (Vector Autoregression), are
widely used for time series forecasting. These models analyze historical
inflation data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations,
which can then be used to predict future inflation rates. The ARIMA
model, in particular, is effective in capturing the autoregressive (AR)
and moving average (MA) components of time series data and handling
stationarity through differencing.

In contrast, \textbf{machine learning models}, such as \textbf{Support
Vector Machines (SVM)} and \textbf{Random Forests}, have emerged as
powerful tools for forecasting inflation in more recent years. These
models excel at handling large, complex datasets and can identify
non-linear relationships between inflation and other economic variables.
SVM, for example, can efficiently perform regression tasks in
high-dimensional feature spaces, while Random Forest is an ensemble
learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction
accuracy and avoid overfitting.

In addition to these models, \textbf{hybrid approaches} combining
traditional econometric methods with machine learning techniques are
gaining popularity. These hybrid models aim to leverage the strengths of
both approaches to improve forecasting accuracy and robustness.

The importance of inflation forecasting extends beyond prediction
accuracy. It also involves understanding the underlying economic factors
that drive inflation. By integrating various economic indicators---such
as employment rates, wage growth, interest rates, and external factors
like oil prices---into forecasting models, analysts can create more
comprehensive and accurate predictions. Additionally, forecasting
inflation helps in managing expectations among businesses, consumers,
and investors, reducing uncertainty and fostering confidence in economic
policies.

\hypertarget{overview-of-forecasting-methods}{%
\subsubsection{Overview of Forecasting
Methods}\label{overview-of-forecasting-methods}}

\hypertarget{arima-autoregressive-integrated-moving-average}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated
Moving
Average)}}{ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)}}\label{arima-autoregressive-integrated-moving-average}}

ARIMA is one of the most widely used time series forecasting models. It
is particularly popular for economic forecasting, including inflation,
due to its ability to model the underlying trends, seasonality, and
autocorrelations in the data. The ARIMA model consists of three main
components:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{AR (AutoRegressive)}: This component represents the
  relationship between an observation and a specified number of lagged
  observations (i.e., past values). The AR term captures the influence
  of previous time periods on future values.
\item
  \textbf{I (Integrated)}: This component involves differencing the
  series to make it stationary. Stationarity refers to a time series
  whose statistical properties, such as mean and variance, do not change
  over time. Differencing helps eliminate trends and seasonality from
  the data, ensuring the model is applied to a stationary series.
\item
  \textbf{MA (Moving Average)}: The MA component models the relationship
  between an observation and the residual errors from a moving average
  model applied to lagged observations. This captures short-term random
  shocks or noise in the data.
\end{itemize}

ARIMA models are particularly effective for forecasting inflation
because inflation data often exhibit time-dependent patterns and cycles,
which ARIMA can model efficiently. It can handle both short-term
fluctuations and long-term trends, making it suitable for forecasting
economic indicators such as inflation, especially in developed economies
like the USA.

Many studies have applied ARIMA for forecasting inflation in the USA,
given its robustness in time series modeling. For instance, \textbf{Zhou
et al. (2019)} used ARIMA models to forecast inflation in the USA,
comparing its predictions with actual CPI data and demonstrating its
reliability for short-term forecasting. Similarly, \textbf{Lee and Lee
(2017)} applied ARIMA to predict inflation and compared its performance
against other econometric models, finding ARIMA to be a strong contender
for medium-term inflation forecasting.

\hypertarget{support-vector-machine-svm}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Support Vector Machine
(SVM)}}{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}}\label{support-vector-machine-svm}}

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm
traditionally used for classification tasks but has also proven
effective for regression tasks, particularly in time series forecasting.
SVM operates by finding the hyperplane that best separates data points
into different classes (for classification) or predicts a continuous
value (for regression). The \textbf{Support Vector Regression (SVR)}
variant of SVM is commonly used for time series forecasting tasks, as it
seeks to find the best-fitting line or curve that minimizes the error
within a specified margin.

One of the key strengths of SVM for forecasting is its ability to model
non-linear relationships in the data, which makes it more flexible than
traditional time series models like ARIMA. In the context of inflation
forecasting, SVM can capture complex relationships between inflation and
other macroeconomic variables (such as GDP, unemployment, and interest
rates) that may not be linearly related.

Studies comparing SVM to traditional time series models, like ARIMA,
have found that SVM often outperforms ARIMA, especially when there are
non-linear patterns or multiple influencing factors. \textbf{Chong et
al. (2017)} compared the performance of SVM and ARIMA in forecasting US
inflation and found that SVM provided more accurate predictions,
particularly when dealing with high-dimensional economic data. Moreover,
\textbf{Xu et al. (2020)} demonstrated that SVR, when applied to
inflation forecasting in the USA, provided better accuracy than ARIMA,
especially in cases with irregular or non-stationary data.

\hypertarget{random-forest}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Random
Forest}}{Random Forest}}\label{random-forest}}

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple
decision trees and combines their predictions to produce a more accurate
and stable forecast. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the
data, and the final output is determined by aggregating the results from
all individual trees (usually by averaging for regression tasks). The
strength of Random Forest lies in its ability to model complex,
non-linear relationships and handle high-dimensional datasets without
the risk of overfitting.

In time series forecasting, Random Forest can be applied by treating the
past observations of the time series as input features to predict future
values. It can also be used alongside other models, such as ARIMA or
SVM, in hybrid approaches. Random Forest has been shown to be
particularly useful for forecasting inflation because it can incorporate
multiple economic indicators simultaneously and handle non-linearities
in the relationships between variables.

Studies comparing Random Forest to other time series forecasting models,
such as ARIMA and SVM, have demonstrated its competitive performance.
\textbf{Sharma et al. (2018)} applied Random Forest to forecast
inflation in the USA and found that it consistently outperformed ARIMA,
especially in the presence of multiple variables that affect inflation.
Moreover, \textbf{Rashid et al. (2020)} concluded that Random Forest was
particularly effective when dealing with datasets that contain a mix of
categorical and continuous variables, which are common in macroeconomic
forecasting.

\hypertarget{comparison-and-performance}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Comparison and
Performance}}{Comparison and Performance}}\label{comparison-and-performance}}

When comparing the three models---ARIMA, SVM, and Random Forest---for
inflation forecasting, each has its strengths. ARIMA is a robust,
well-understood model that excels in capturing temporal dependencies in
historical inflation data. However, it may struggle to handle
non-linearities and interactions between multiple variables. SVM, on the
other hand, is highly effective in modeling non-linear relationships and
is often more accurate when economic data exhibits complex patterns.
Random Forest, with its ensemble approach, provides high accuracy by
leveraging multiple decision trees, and it is particularly effective
when dealing with large, high-dimensional datasets.

In the context of the USA, all three methods have been shown to produce
reliable inflation forecasts, but the choice of model often depends on
the specific characteristics of the data and the forecasting horizon.
Studies suggest that while ARIMA remains a solid choice for short-term
forecasts, machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest tend to
offer superior performance for medium to long-term inflation
forecasting, especially in the presence of complex interactions and
non-linear trends.

\hypertarget{review-of-empirical-studies}{%
\subsubsection{Review of Empirical
Studies}\label{review-of-empirical-studies}}

\hypertarget{usa-specific-studies}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{USA-specific
Studies:}}{USA-specific Studies:}}\label{usa-specific-studies}}

Several studies have specifically focused on inflation forecasting for
the United States using various methodologies. \textbf{Fulton and
Hubrich (2021)} explored the performance of real-time U.S. inflation
forecasts from 1999 to 2019. Their analysis showed that combining
forecasts and using disaggregated inflation components significantly
improved prediction accuracy, especially after 2009. The researchers
concluded that employing multiple models and incorporating diverse
macroeconomic indicators, such as energy prices and labor market data,
enhances the precision of inflation forecasts. The study supports the
use of forecast combination strategies, which aligns with the current
study\textquotesingle s methodology of utilizing multiple models for
inflation forecasting.

\textbf{Abuselidze (2022)} examined the relationship between oil price
fluctuations and inflation in the U.S. from 2000 to 2021. Through
regression analysis, the study identified a significant positive
correlation between rising oil prices and inflation, emphasizing the
importance of including oil prices as an independent variable in
inflation forecasting models. This conclusion supports the current
study\textquotesingle s approach of integrating oil prices into the
model to improve prediction accuracy.

\textbf{Mishkin (1990)} tested the hypothesis that short-term interest
rates can predict inflation, finding that variations in nominal
short-term interest rates are significantly associated with changes in
expected inflation. This supports the inclusion of interest rates as a
key variable in inflation forecasting models and is consistent with the
current study\textquotesingle s methodology, which uses short-term
interest rates as a predictor.

\textbf{Amaral et al. (2022)} analyzed the impact of U.S. monetary
policy on inflation and economic growth over the long term, using a
Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. They found that expansionary monetary
policy, while leading to short-term GDP growth, also results in
long-term inflationary pressures. This highlights the importance of
incorporating monetary policy variables, such as interest rates and
money supply, in forecasting U.S. inflation, which aligns with the
approach taken in this study.

\hypertarget{comparison-across-models}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Comparison Across
Models:}}{Comparison Across Models:}}\label{comparison-across-models}}

A number of studies have also compared the performance of traditional
econometric models like ARIMA with advanced machine learning techniques
such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest in forecasting
U.S. inflation.

\textbf{Tattikota and Srinivasan (2021)} compared ARIMA, Ridge, LASSO,
Elastic Net, and Random Forest for forecasting U.S. inflation and
unemployment. Their findings indicated that machine learning models,
particularly Random Forest and Elastic Net, outperformed traditional
econometric models in terms of predictive accuracy. The authors noted
that while ARIMA is suitable for time series forecasting, machine
learning models capture complex, non-linear relationships within the
data, thus improving forecasting precision. This insight reinforces the
current study\textquotesingle s use of both traditional and advanced
models for inflation forecasting, especially in capturing intricate
patterns in economic data.

\textbf{Boesch and Ziegelmann (2024)} introduced the Weighted Lag
Adaptive Elastic Net (WLadaENet), a novel machine learning model, and
applied it to U.S. inflation data from 2013 to 2023. Their study
demonstrated that WLadaENet, which combines Ridge Regression with a time
series-adapted regularization method, outperformed traditional models,
especially when handling high-dimensional and nonlinear data. This
finding supports the incorporation of advanced machine learning
techniques such as Elastic Net in forecasting inflation, which is
aligned with the current study\textquotesingle s methodology of
utilizing machine learning models.

\textbf{Yadav et al. (2023)} compared machine learning models, including
Random Forest and SVM, to traditional econometric methods for
forecasting the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The study found that
machine learning models outperformed classical models, particularly in
predicting CPI. This reinforces the view that advanced machine learning
techniques are highly effective in capturing complex inflation patterns,
providing stronger predictive accuracy compared to traditional
econometric models.

\textbf{Alomani, Kayid, and Abd El-Aal (2025)} conducted a comparative
analysis of ARIMA and advanced machine learning models for global
inflation forecasting. They found that ARIMA works well for short-term
forecasting but falls short in capturing complex, nonlinear
relationships, which machine learning models such as Random Forest and
Elastic Net handle more effectively. This supports the current study's
emphasis on using machine learning models alongside ARIMA for more
accurate inflation forecasting.

\textbf{Sivaprasad and Srinivas (2012)} introduced a hybrid model
combining Genetic Algorithms with Support Vector Regression (GA--SVR)
for forecasting macroeconomic variables, including inflation. Their
study found that the GA--SVR model significantly outperformed
traditional econometric models in capturing nonlinear relationships and
interactions among economic indicators. This emphasizes the potential of
combining machine learning techniques with evolutionary algorithms, a
concept reflected in the current study\textquotesingle s approach of
using SVM and Random Forest for U.S. inflation forecasting.

\textbf{Hossfeld (2010)} investigated the role of money overhang in
inflation forecasting for the U.S. between 1987 and 2008. Using a
cointegrated VAR model, the study found that money overhang plays a
significant role in inflation predictions. This underscores the
importance of including variables related to money supply, such as M2,
in forecasting models. The research findings align with the current
study's methodology, which includes money supply variables to enhance
forecasting precision.

\hypertarget{challenges-and-limitations-in-forecasting-inflation}{%
\subsubsection{Challenges and Limitations in Forecasting
Inflation}\label{challenges-and-limitations-in-forecasting-inflation}}

\hypertarget{model-limitations}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Model
Limitations:}}{Model Limitations:}}\label{model-limitations}}

Each forecasting method used in inflation prediction comes with its own
set of challenges and limitations.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):\\
  } ARIMA is a widely used method for time series forecasting, but it
  has notable limitations. One of the primary challenges is
  \textbf{model complexity}. ARIMA models require careful tuning of
  parameters, such as the order of autoregression (AR), differencing
  (I), and moving average (MA), which can be difficult and
  time-consuming. Additionally, ARIMA assumes stationarity in the data,
  which means that the underlying inflation series must have constant
  statistical properties over time. In practice, this assumption is
  often violated, leading to potential model inaccuracies. Furthermore,
  ARIMA is less effective in capturing \textbf{sudden economic shocks}
  or structural breaks, such as those caused by political events or
  financial crises, which can result in forecast errors when such shocks
  are not accounted for in the model.
\item
  \textbf{Support Vector Machines (SVM):\\
  } SVM, while a powerful machine learning tool, is prone to
  \textbf{overfitting}. This occurs when the model becomes too complex
  and starts to "memorize" the training data rather than generalizing
  from it, leading to poor performance on unseen data. SVMs also require
  the proper selection of kernel functions and regularization
  parameters, which can be computationally intensive. Moreover, SVMs
  struggle with \textbf{scalability} when working with large datasets,
  as the computation time increases significantly with the size of the
  data. Another issue with SVM is its reliance on having a large amount
  of high-quality data to accurately train the model, which may not
  always be available for inflation forecasting.
\item
  \textbf{Random Forest:\\
  } While Random Forest is a robust and flexible machine learning model,
  it is not without its challenges. One key issue is its
  \textbf{interpretability}. Unlike ARIMA, which provides clear insights
  into the relationships between variables, Random Forest models can be
  considered "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how
  specific features (such as oil prices or interest rates) contribute to
  the inflation forecast. Another limitation of Random Forest is its
  tendency to \textbf{overfit} if the number of trees is too large,
  leading to reduced model generalization. Moreover, Random Forest
  models may struggle to effectively capture \textbf{non-linear
  relationships} when the data is not sufficiently diverse or when the
  trees do not fully explore the feature space.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-limitations}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Data
Limitations:}}{Data Limitations:}}\label{data-limitations}}

The accuracy of any inflation forecasting model is heavily reliant on
the quality and availability of data. However, several data-related
issues present significant challenges in forecasting inflation.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Missing Values:\\
  } Real-world economic data often contains missing values due to
  incomplete reporting or measurement errors. Missing data can undermine
  the quality of inflation forecasts, as it may lead to biased estimates
  or reduce the sample size, which could affect the statistical
  significance of the results. While there are techniques to handle
  missing data, such as imputation, these methods can introduce their
  own set of errors if not handled properly.
\item
  \textbf{Lack of Real-Time Data:\\
  } Inflation forecasting typically requires up-to-date data on
  macroeconomic indicators, such as interest rates, employment figures,
  and consumer prices. However, many critical economic indicators are
  reported with a lag, which limits the ability of forecasters to make
  real-time predictions. This lag between data collection and its
  availability to modelers can be especially problematic during periods
  of rapid economic change, where real-time forecasts are crucial.
\item
  \textbf{Issues in Variable Selection:\\
  } Selecting the right set of variables to include in an inflation
  forecasting model is a challenge. Economic systems are complex, and
  inflation is influenced by a variety of factors, such as commodity
  prices, monetary policy, and geopolitical events. However, not all
  relevant variables may be readily available or easy to quantify,
  leading to incomplete models. Additionally, overfitting can occur if
  too many variables are included, making the model overly sensitive to
  small changes in the data, while underfitting can result from an
  oversimplified model that omits critical predictors.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{external-factors}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{External
Factors:}}{External Factors:}}\label{external-factors}}

Inflation forecasting is not just about selecting the right model and
data; it is also heavily influenced by external factors that can
complicate predictions and lead to significant forecasting errors.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Political Events and Policy Changes:\\
  } Sudden shifts in government policies, such as changes in taxation,
  fiscal spending, or monetary policy, can have a direct impact on
  inflation. For example, a sudden increase in government spending or
  changes in central bank interest rates can cause unexpected
  inflationary pressure. Political instability, such as elections,
  regime changes, or geopolitical tensions, can also create volatility
  in inflation, making it difficult for forecasting models to accurately
  predict future trends.
\item
  \textbf{Global Crises:\\
  } Events like financial crises, pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), or global
  supply chain disruptions can lead to dramatic and sudden shifts in
  inflation. These events often introduce \textbf{structural breaks} in
  the economic system, causing traditional models, such as ARIMA, to
  underperform. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted both
  demand and supply across various sectors, creating unpredictable
  inflationary patterns that were not anticipated by pre-existing
  models. Such global shocks are particularly challenging for models
  that rely on historical data to make predictions, as they represent a
  fundamental departure from past economic behavior.
\item
  \textbf{Market Shifts and External Shocks:\\
  } Inflation forecasting models also struggle with the unpredictability
  of market dynamics, such as shifts in global commodity prices (e.g.,
  oil, metals) or currency fluctuations. These shifts can influence
  inflation in ways that are difficult to model, especially when they
  occur suddenly or are not adequately captured in the data. For
  example, a sudden spike in oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in
  the Middle East can significantly raise inflation, but this type of
  shock is hard to forecast with high accuracy, especially in models
  that rely on historical relationships.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In conclusion, inflation forecasting remains a critical area of study
for economists, policymakers, and businesses alike. The literature
review reveals a diverse set of methods for forecasting inflation,
including traditional models like ARIMA, as well as more advanced
machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
Random Forest. Each method has its strengths and limitations, which were
discussed in detail, with ARIMA being favored for its simplicity and
interpretability, while SVM and Random Forest are often chosen for their
flexibility and ability to capture complex patterns in large datasets.

Empirical studies specifically focused on the USA have provided valuable
insights into the accuracy and performance of these methods in
real-world settings. Studies comparing these techniques have
demonstrated that, while machine learning models tend to outperform
traditional models in terms of predictive accuracy, they also face
challenges such as overfitting and lack of interpretability.
Furthermore, external factors like political events, global crises, and
economic shocks continue to pose significant challenges to the accuracy
of inflation forecasting models.

Overall, while the current methods for forecasting inflation offer
valuable insights, the complexity and volatility of the global economy
suggest that there is still room for improvement in these techniques.
Future research should focus on refining existing models, incorporating
more diverse datasets, and considering the role of external economic
shocks in shaping inflation trends.

\hypertarget{description-of-variables-and-data}{%
\subsubsection{Description of Variables and
Data}\label{description-of-variables-and-data}}

This section outlines the data preparation procedures and offers an
in-depth explanation of the variables selected for modeling inflation.
The selection is grounded in both economic theory and empirical findings
from previous studies. Each variable plays a distinct role in explaining
inflationary trends in the U.S. economy.

\hypertarget{data-source-and-frequency-alignment}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Data Source and Frequency
Alignment}}{Data Source and Frequency Alignment}}\label{data-source-and-frequency-alignment}}

The data used in this study was obtained from the \textbf{Federal
Reserve Economic Data (FRED)} repository, maintained by the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. FRED is a widely respected and credible
source of macroeconomic data and provides regularly updated time-series
data for economic research and forecasting.

However, a common issue encountered was \textbf{disparity in the data
frequencies}. While inflation and unemployment are typically measured
and reported \textbf{monthly}, other variables like \textbf{GDP} and
\textbf{M2} are often \textbf{quarterly}. To enable coherent analysis
and time-series modeling, it was essential to bring all variables to a
\textbf{uniform monthly frequency}.

To address this, \textbf{data transformation and preprocessing were
conducted in R}, using custom-written code. The key preprocessing steps
included:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Temporal alignment}: All variables were adjusted to match a
  uniform monthly timeline ranging over the same period.
\item
  \textbf{Upsampling of quarterly data}: Variables such as GDP and M2
  were interpolated from quarterly to monthly frequency using
  \textbf{linear interpolation} and \textbf{spline methods} to maintain
  trend accuracy.
\item
  \textbf{Missing value treatment}: Missing or irregular data points
  were handled through \textbf{forward fill}, \textbf{backward fill}, or
  \textbf{mean imputation}, depending on the context.
\item
  \textbf{Normalization and scaling}: Log transformations and percent
  change calculations were used where necessary to stabilize variance
  and enhance model convergence.
\end{itemize}

This preprocessing step ensured a well-structured dataset with
synchronized variables, ready for time-series forecasting using models
like ARIMA, SVM, and Random Forest.

\hypertarget{selected-variables-and-their-theoretical-importance}{%
\subsubsection{Selected Variables and Their Theoretical
Importance}\label{selected-variables-and-their-theoretical-importance}}

The following variables were selected based on their proven relevance in
macroeconomic literature, policy frameworks, and empirical studies:

\hypertarget{inflation-consumer-price-index---cpi-dependent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. Inflation (Consumer Price Index -
CPI) --- Dependent
Variable}}{1. Inflation (Consumer Price Index - CPI) --- Dependent Variable}}\label{inflation-consumer-price-index---cpi-dependent-variable}}

Inflation, as measured by the \textbf{Consumer Price Index (CPI)}, is
the \textbf{dependent variable} and the core focus of this study. The
CPI reflects the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
consumers for a representative basket of goods and services.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Why CPI?}: It is the most commonly used measure of inflation,
  affecting wage contracts, pensions, interest rates, and monetary
  policy decisions.
\item
  \textbf{Relevance}: CPI captures short-term price dynamics and serves
  as a barometer for purchasing power and cost-of-living changes.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Monthly CPI data was collected from FRED (Series ID:
  CPIAUCNS).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{oil-prices-independent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Oil Prices --- Independent
Variable}}{2. Oil Prices --- Independent Variable}}\label{oil-prices-independent-variable}}

Oil prices are a critical external factor that directly influences
production costs, transportation, and energy sectors. Changes in oil
prices are often reflected in consumer prices, particularly in the short
term.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Economic Theory}: Higher oil prices can lead to
  \textbf{cost-push inflation}, especially in energy-dependent economies
  like the U.S.
\item
  \textbf{Recent Context}: Volatile oil prices during geopolitical
  crises (e.g., Russia-Ukraine conflict) highlight their significant
  impact on inflation forecasting.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Monthly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil
  prices obtained from FRED (Series ID: DCOILWTICO).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{money-supply-m2-independent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. Money Supply (M2) --- Independent
Variable}}{3. Money Supply (M2) --- Independent Variable}}\label{money-supply-m2-independent-variable}}

The \textbf{M2 money supply} includes cash, checking deposits, and
easily convertible near-money assets. It serves as a proxy for liquidity
and monetary expansion in the economy.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Theoretical Foundation}: According to \textbf{monetarist
  economists} (e.g., Milton Friedman), inflation is fundamentally a
  monetary phenomenon --- when the money supply grows faster than
  economic output, inflation tends to rise.
\item
  \textbf{Empirical Insight}: A lagged relationship often exists between
  changes in money supply and inflation.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Quarterly M2 data from FRED (Series ID: M2SL),
  interpolated to monthly frequency.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{gross-domestic-product-gdp-independent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{4. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ---
Independent
Variable}}{4. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) --- Independent Variable}}\label{gross-domestic-product-gdp-independent-variable}}

GDP represents the overall output of the economy and is a crucial
measure of \textbf{aggregate demand} and \textbf{economic activity}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Relevance to Inflation}: Rising GDP can signal increased
  demand for goods and services, potentially leading to
  \textbf{demand-pull inflation} when supply fails to keep pace.
\item
  \textbf{Challenges}: Reported quarterly, GDP was transformed using
  interpolation techniques to create a monthly equivalent for model
  input.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Real GDP from FRED (Series ID: GDPC1).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interest-rate-federal-funds-rate-independent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{5. Interest Rate (Federal Funds Rate)
--- Independent
Variable}}{5. Interest Rate (Federal Funds Rate) --- Independent Variable}}\label{interest-rate-federal-funds-rate-independent-variable}}

The Federal Funds Rate is a key monetary policy instrument used by the
Federal Reserve to manage economic activity and inflation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mechanism}: Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and
  spending, thus easing inflation. Conversely, lower rates can stimulate
  the economy but may risk inflation.
\item
  \textbf{Policy Link}: This variable acts as a direct policy response
  indicator that captures the \textbf{Federal Reserve's stance} on
  inflation.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Monthly data from FRED (Series ID: FEDFUNDS).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{unemployment-rate-independent-variable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{6. Unemployment Rate --- Independent
Variable}}{6. Unemployment Rate --- Independent Variable}}\label{unemployment-rate-independent-variable}}

The unemployment rate is a central labor market indicator and is closely
tied to inflation through the \textbf{Phillips Curve}, which posits an
inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wage-Price Spiral}: Low unemployment can lead to rising wages,
  which in turn increase consumer spending and drive prices up.
\item
  \textbf{Inflation Trade-offs}: Policymakers often face trade-offs
  between reducing unemployment and controlling inflation.
\item
  \textbf{Source}: Monthly data from FRED (Series ID: UNRATE).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{rationale-for-variable-inclusion}{%
\subsubsection{Rationale for Variable
Inclusion}\label{rationale-for-variable-inclusion}}

These variables were chosen based on:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Economic theory} (e.g., Quantity Theory of Money, Phillips
  Curve, supply-demand framework),
\item
  \textbf{Empirical support} from past research (as detailed in the
  literature review), and
\item
  \textbf{Policy relevance}, reflecting the key levers influencing
  inflation in the U.S. economy.
\end{itemize}

Collectively, they cover \textbf{monetary}, \textbf{real economic},
\textbf{labor market}, and \textbf{external supply-side} dimensions of
inflation. Their interaction provides a nuanced and multidimensional
view required for robust inflation forecasting.

\hypertarget{dataset-limitations}{%
\subsubsection{Dataset Limitations}\label{dataset-limitations}}

While the data collection and transformation process were rigorous, a
few limitations are acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Interpolation Risk}: Converting quarterly data to monthly
  frequency may smooth out short-term shocks or inflection points.
\item
  \textbf{Lag Structures}: Many macroeconomic variables influence
  inflation with delayed effects; improper lag specification could
  reduce model accuracy.
\item
  \textbf{External Omitted Variables}: Events such as global pandemics,
  wars, or fiscal policy changes were not explicitly modeled but may
  influence inflation dynamics indirectly.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{section}{%
\subsubsection{}\label{section}}

\hypertarget{conclusion-1}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}}

In summary, the dataset used for this study comprises key macroeconomic
variables that are well-grounded in theory and practice. Using data from
FRED ensures accuracy and reliability, while preprocessing in R enabled
uniformity in frequency and structure. This data foundation is essential
for the development of predictive models and for understanding the
driving forces behind inflation in the U.S.

\hypertarget{estimation-of-the-models}{%
\subsection{Estimation of the Models}\label{estimation-of-the-models}}

In this section, we estimate three distinct models to understand the
behavior and determinants of inflation in our dataset: \textbf{ARIMA},
\textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}, and \textbf{Random Forest}. Each
model uses macroeconomic variables including \textbf{Date} (treated
numerically to represent time), \textbf{Money Supply (M2)}, and
\textbf{Unemployment Rate} to predict the dependent variable,
\textbf{Inflation}. We begin by exploring the theoretical background of
each model, followed by its estimated form based on the provided output,
and conclude with a thorough interpretation of the estimated results.

\hypertarget{arima-model-autoregressive-integrated-moving-average}{%
\subsubsection{ARIMA Model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving
Average)}\label{arima-model-autoregressive-integrated-moving-average}}

The ARIMA model is a classical statistical technique designed
specifically for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It captures
three components:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{AR (AutoRegressive)}: uses the dependency between an
  observation and a number of lagged observations.
\item
  \textbf{I (Integrated)}: represents differencing of raw observations
  to make the time series stationary.
\item
  \textbf{MA (Moving Average)}: models the dependency between an
  observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied
  to lagged observations.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{general-form-of-arima-with-exogenous-variables-arimax}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{General Form of ARIMA with Exogenous
Variables
(ARIMAX)}}{General Form of ARIMA with Exogenous Variables (ARIMAX)}}\label{general-form-of-arima-with-exogenous-variables-arimax}}

The general equation for an ARIMA(p,d,q) model with exogenous regressors
is:

\includegraphics[width=5.21875in,height=0.80208in]{image3.png}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  YtY\_tYt\hspace{0pt} is the dependent variable (Inflation in our
  case).
\item
  ϕi\textbackslash phi\_iϕi\hspace{0pt} are the autoregressive
  parameters.
\item
  θj\textbackslash theta\_jθj\hspace{0pt} are the moving average
  parameters.
\item
  Xk,tX\_\{k,t\}Xk,t\hspace{0pt} are the exogenous independent variables
  (Date, M2, Unemployment).
\item
  βk\textbackslash beta\_kβk\hspace{0pt} are the coefficients of
  exogenous regressors.
\item
  εt\textbackslash varepsilon\_tεt\hspace{0pt} is the error term.
\end{itemize}

In our case, the ARIMA model selected is \textbf{ARIMA(1,0,0)},
indicating one autoregressive term and no differencing or moving average
components.

\hypertarget{estimated-arima-model-equation}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Estimated ARIMA Model
Equation}}{Estimated ARIMA Model Equation}}\label{estimated-arima-model-equation}}

Based on the R output, the estimated model becomes:

Inflationt=−25.2857+0.6269⋅Inflationt−1+0.0016⋅Datet−0.4819⋅M2t−0.0204⋅Unemploymentt+εt\textbackslash text\{Inflation\}\_t

\hypertarget{interpretation-of-the-coefficients-and-predictions}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Interpretation of the Coefficients
and
Predictions}}{Interpretation of the Coefficients and Predictions}}\label{interpretation-of-the-coefficients-and-predictions}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{intercept} (-25.2857) sets the baseline level of inflation
  when all other variables are zero, though practically
  it\textquotesingle s more useful as an adjustment term.
\item
  The \textbf{autoregressive term} (0.6269) indicates that past
  inflation values have a strong positive influence on current
  inflation. Specifically, a one-unit increase in last period's
  inflation increases current inflation by about 0.63 units, holding all
  else constant.
\item
  The \textbf{Date} variable has a positive coefficient (0.0016),
  implying a slight upward trend in inflation over time.
\item
  The \textbf{M2 (Money Supply)} coefficient is negative (-0.4819),
  suggesting that an increase in money supply is associated with a
  reduction in inflation, which might reflect certain monetary policies
  in the dataset period.
\item
  The \textbf{Unemployment Rate} also has a small negative impact
  (-0.0204), meaning rising unemployment correlates with slightly lower
  inflation, possibly indicating demand-pull inflation effects.
\end{itemize}

The relatively low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.1494) and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE = 18.30\%) suggest that the ARIMA model
has a fair prediction accuracy for inflation values in the training
dataset.

\hypertarget{support-vector-machine-svm-regression-model}{%
\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression
Model}\label{support-vector-machine-svm-regression-model}}

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning models
originally developed for classification but adapted effectively for
regression tasks. SVM regression, particularly \textbf{ε-Support Vector
Regression (ε-SVR)}, attempts to find a function that deviates from the
actual observed values by no more than ε for each training point, while
being as flat (or simple) as possible.

\hypertarget{section-1}{%
\paragraph{}\label{section-1}}

The SVM regression model with a nonlinear kernel can be represented as:

\hypertarget{section-2}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\protect\includegraphics[width=4.19792in,height=0.80208in]{image4.png}}{}}\label{section-2}}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  y\^{}(x)\textbackslash hat\{y\}(x)y\^{}\hspace{0pt}(x) is the
  predicted value of inflation,
\item
  xix\_ixi\hspace{0pt} are the support vectors,
\item
  αi\textbackslash alpha\_iαi\hspace{0pt} are learned coefficients from
  training,
\item
  K(xi,x)K(x\_i, x)K(xi\hspace{0pt},x) is the kernel function (in our
  case, Radial Basis Function),
\item
  bbb is the bias term.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Radial Basis Function (RBF)} kernel used here is defined as:

\includegraphics[width=3.25in,height=0.64583in]{image5.png}

This allows the model to capture complex nonlinear relationships between
inflation and the input features.

\hypertarget{estimated-svm-model-based-on-output}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Estimated SVM Model Based on
Output}}{Estimated SVM Model Based on Output}}\label{estimated-svm-model-based-on-output}}

From the R output:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The kernel type is RBF with \textbf{γ = 0.333},
\item
  The cost parameter \textbf{C = 1}, which controls the trade-off
  between margin width and training error,
\item
  The \textbf{ε = 0.1}, defining the insensitive zone around the actual
  values,
\item
  A total of \textbf{10 support vectors} were used in constructing the
  regression function.
\end{itemize}

The model is not expressed explicitly through coefficients for each
feature like linear models. Instead, it implicitly defines a regression
surface shaped by support vectors and kernel functions.

\hypertarget{interpretation-and-predictions}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Interpretation and
Predictions}}{Interpretation and Predictions}}\label{interpretation-and-predictions}}

Unlike ARIMA, the SVM model does not yield a linear equation with
clear-cut coefficients for each input variable. However, it fits a
\textbf{nonlinear surface} that attempts to minimize prediction error
within the specified ε tolerance.

The support vector coefficients (e.g., -1.000, -0.9517, etc.) indicate
the contributions of these observations in shaping the regression
function. The model's structure allows it to effectively model nonlinear
interactions between \textbf{Inflation}, \textbf{Date}, \textbf{M2}, and
\textbf{Unemployment}, which may be too complex for a simple linear
model.

This model is expected to perform well on capturing subtle nonlinear
patterns, especially when economic relationships deviate from linear
assumptions.

\hypertarget{random-forest-regression-model}{%
\subsubsection{Random Forest Regression
Model}\label{random-forest-regression-model}}

Random Forest is a tree-based ensemble learning method that builds
multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average
prediction of the individual trees. It handles \textbf{nonlinearities},
\textbf{interactions}, and \textbf{multicollinearity} well without
requiring strong parametric assumptions.

\hypertarget{general-logic-of-random-forest-regression}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{General Logic of Random Forest
Regression}}{General Logic of Random Forest Regression}}\label{general-logic-of-random-forest-regression}}

There is no fixed "equation" for Random Forest like linear models.
Instead, each decision tree splits the feature space into distinct
regions and assigns a prediction based on training data in those
regions. The final prediction is the \textbf{average} of predictions
across all trees:

\includegraphics[width=2.23958in,height=0.75in]{image6.png}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  TTT is the number of trees,
\item
  ft(x)f\_t(x)ft\hspace{0pt}(x) is the prediction from tree ttt,
\item
  xxx is the vector of input features (Date, M2, Unemployment).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{estimated-insights-from-the-random-forest-output}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Estimated Insights from the Random
Forest
Output}}{Estimated Insights from the Random Forest Output}}\label{estimated-insights-from-the-random-forest-output}}

From the output:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Feature importance scores (based on \textbf{Increase in Node Purity})
  were:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{M2}: 4.372
  \item
    \textbf{Date}: 4.293
  \item
    \textbf{Unemployment}: 4.286
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

These scores show that \textbf{Money Supply (M2)} was the most
influential feature in predicting inflation, followed closely by
\textbf{Date} and \textbf{Unemployment}.

An example of a decision rule from the first tree is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If \textbf{Date \textless{} 15476}, then check M2:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \textbf{M2 \textless{} -1.0519}, then predict value from Leaf 4.
  \item
    Else predict value from Leaf 5.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If \textbf{Date ≥ 15476}, check again:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \textbf{Date \textless{} 16115.5}, predict from Leaf 6.
  \item
    Else predict from Leaf 7.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Each such rule is a simple if-else condition on one feature. The model
combines hundreds of such rules to form a robust prediction mechanism.

\hypertarget{interpretation-and-predictions-1}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Interpretation and
Predictions}}{Interpretation and Predictions}}\label{interpretation-and-predictions-1}}

The Random Forest model captures \textbf{nonlinear and interaction
effects} automatically. For instance, it can detect if the effect of
unemployment on inflation depends on the money supply or changes over
time, without explicitly modeling these interactions.

Since it does not produce an algebraic equation, interpretability is
lower than that of ARIMA. However, the predictive power is usually
higher, particularly in data with complex structure.

The model assigns higher importance to M2, which suggests that changes
in the money supply are a significant predictor of inflation in this
dataset.

\hypertarget{conclusion-of-model-estimations}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion of Model
Estimations}\label{conclusion-of-model-estimations}}

The ARIMA model offers a \textbf{statistically interpretable} equation
rooted in time series theory. It reveals that past inflation and
temporal trends play a significant role. The SVM model adds a
\textbf{nonlinear layer}, learning subtle patterns via support vectors
and kernel functions, while the Random Forest model provides the
\textbf{most flexible predictive structure}, capable of capturing
nonlinearities and variable interactions without predefined form.

Each model has its strengths:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ARIMA: Best for \textbf{interpretable temporal relationships}.
\item
  SVM: Suitable for \textbf{nonlinear regression} with moderate
  complexity.
\item
  Random Forest: Ideal for \textbf{high-performance, flexible
  predictions} where interpretability is less critical.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Summary Statistics and Graphs}

This section provides an overview of the key summary statistics for the
dataset, which includes the variables \textbf{Date}, \textbf{Inflation},
\textbf{Unemployment}, \textbf{GDP}, \textbf{InterestRate}, \textbf{M2},
and \textbf{Oil}. These statistics are crucial for understanding the
central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of the data, which will
help in interpreting the results of the modeling process.

The summary statistics for each of the variables are as follows:

\hypertarget{date}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Date}}{Date}}\label{date}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Min:} 2009-04-01
\item
  \textbf{1st Qu. (25\%):} 2012-12-31
\item
  \textbf{Median (50\%):} 2015-10-01
\item
  \textbf{Mean:} 2016-07-29
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 2020-08-16
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 2024-10-01
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Date} variable represents the time period of the dataset,
ranging from \textbf{April 2009} to \textbf{October 2024}. The
\textbf{mean date} is approximately \textbf{July 2016}, with the
\textbf{median date} falling slightly earlier in \textbf{October 2015}.
This suggests a dataset with a relatively balanced distribution over
time, though with a slight skew toward the more recent years.

\hypertarget{inflation}{%

  \textbf{Mean:} 249.5
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 259.7
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 315.7
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Inflation} variable spans from a \textbf{minimum of 213.2}
to a \textbf{maximum of 315.7}. The \textbf{mean} inflation rate is
\textbf{249.5}, which is slightly higher than the \textbf{median} value
of \textbf{238.7}, indicating that the distribution is skewed to the
right, possibly due to a few years with high inflation values. The
\textbf{1st and 3rd quartiles} of \textbf{231.9} and \textbf{259.7},
respectively, show a moderate range of inflation values for most of the
dataset.

  \textbf{Mean:} 6.597
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 9.000
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 14.800
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Unemployment} rate ranges from \textbf{3.5\%} to
\textbf{14.8\%}, with a \textbf{mean} of \textbf{6.6\%} and a
\textbf{median} of \textbf{6.1\%}. This shows that while the central
tendency of unemployment is relatively low, there are instances of much
higher unemployment rates, as indicated by the \textbf{maximum value}.
The \textbf{interquartile range} (from 4.35\% to 9\%) suggests that the
data shows moderate variability in unemployment rates over time.

\hypertarget{gdp}{%

  \textbf{Mean:} 2.817
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 3.700
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 35.200
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{GDP} variable has a \textbf{wide range}, from a
\textbf{minimum of -28.1} to a \textbf{maximum of 35.2}. The
\textbf{mean} and \textbf{median} values are quite similar (\textbf{2.8}
and \textbf{2.8}), indicating a fairly symmetric distribution around the
middle. The \textbf{1st and 3rd quartiles} (\textbf{1.35} and
\textbf{3.7}) further confirm this, with the majority of GDP values
falling within this range. The negative GDP value suggests there may
have been a significant economic downturn or recession during the
dataset period.

\hypertarget{interest-rate}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 0.3800
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 5.3300
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Interest Rate} ranges from as low as \textbf{0.05\%} to as
high as \textbf{5.33\%}, with a \textbf{mean} of \textbf{0.85\%}. The
\textbf{median} value is \textbf{0.15\%}, and the \textbf{interquartile
range} (0.09\% to 0.38\%) suggests that interest rates are generally low
but have occasionally spiked. The significant difference between the
\textbf{mean} and the \textbf{median} (0.85\% vs. 0.15\%) indicates that
there are periods with significantly higher interest rates, which could
represent monetary tightening periods.

  \textbf{Mean:} 13997
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 18525
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 21750
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Money Supply (M2)} has a range from \textbf{8391} to
\textbf{21750}, with a \textbf{mean} of \textbf{13997} and a
\textbf{median} of \textbf{12206}, suggesting that the dataset is skewed
toward higher money supply values. The \textbf{interquartile range}
(10442 to 18525) shows that most values fall within a relatively wide
range, with money supply increasing significantly in recent years. This
is a likely reflection of inflationary pressures and monetary policy
responses during the period.

\hypertarget{oil}{%

  \textbf{Mean:} 73.21
\item
  \textbf{3rd Qu. (75\%):} 93.62
\item
  \textbf{Max:} 110.30
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Oil} variable shows prices ranging from \textbf{20.28} to
\textbf{110.30}, with a \textbf{mean} of \textbf{73.21} and a
\textbf{median} of \textbf{75.33}. This indicates that the distribution
is fairly symmetric, with most of the prices falling within the
\textbf{interquartile range} (55.27 to 93.62). The \textbf{maximum
value} of \textbf{110.30} suggests a sharp peak, possibly due to a major
oil price shock or crisis within the dataset period.

\subsection{Results and Conclusion}\label{results-and-conclusion}}

This section synthesizes the outputs and performance of the predictive
models developed to analyze the relationship between macroeconomic
variables and inflation. The models employed include \textbf{ARIMA
(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)}, \textbf{Support Vector
Regression (SVR)}, and \textbf{Random Forest Regression}. Visualizations
such as scatter plots, boxplots, and actual vs. predicted line graphs
have been included to better interpret the results and assess model
accuracy.

\hypertarget{arima-model-results}{%
\subsubsection{ARIMA Model Results}\label{arima-model-results}}

The ARIMA model, specified as ARIMA(1,0,0), was used with inflation as
the dependent variable and key regressors including Date (as a proxy for
time), M2 (money supply), and Unemployment rate. The estimated model
equation is:

\textbf{ARIMA Equation:\\
} \emph{Inflation\textless sub\textgreater t\textless/sub\textgreater{}
= -25.2857 +
0.0016·Date\textless sub\textgreater t\textless/sub\textgreater{} --
0.4819·M2\textless sub\textgreater t\textless/sub\textgreater{} --
0.0204·Unemployment\textless sub\textgreater t\textless/sub\textgreater{}
+
0.6269·Inflation\textless sub\textgreater t--1\textless/sub\textgreater{}
+ ε\textless sub\textgreater t\textless/sub\textgreater{}}

The AR(1) coefficient (0.6269) indicates a moderate degree of
persistence in inflation over time. The negative coefficients of M2 and
Unemployment suggest that higher money supply and unemployment may have
a deflationary effect within the observed period. The model achieved a
low RMSE (0.149) and low MAPE (18.3\%), indicating a reasonable level of
predictive accuracy, albeit with some noise. The AIC and BIC values also
suggest acceptable model fit for time-series analysis.

\hypertarget{support-vector-regression-svr-results}{%
\subsubsection{Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Results}\label{support-vector-regression-svr-results}}

The SVR model was implemented with a \textbf{radial basis function (RBF)
kernel}, which enables it to capture non-linear relationships. The model
used normalized predictors: Date, M2, and Unemployment. It employed a
cost parameter of 1 and epsilon of 0.1, and selected 10 support vectors.

Although the exact regression function is implicit (since SVR forms a
complex kernel-based decision boundary), the model demonstrated strong
performance on the actual vs. predicted inflation graph, accurately
tracking inflation trends across most of the timeline.

SVR captured nonlinearities and subtle interactions more effectively
than the ARIMA model in periods of rapid inflation change, especially
when inflation spikes or drops unexpectedly.

\hypertarget{random-forest-regression-results}{%
\subsubsection{Random Forest Regression
Results}\label{random-forest-regression-results}}

Random Forest, an ensemble-based machine learning method, offered the
advantage of handling nonlinear interactions and providing feature
importance measures.

The importance scores indicated that \textbf{M2} and \textbf{Date} were
the most influential predictors of inflation, followed closely by
\textbf{Unemployment}. The structure of the first decision tree further
confirmed these findings, with initial splits being made on Date and M2
values.

The Random Forest model provided highly accurate predictions, as evident
in the actual vs. predicted plot. It performed robustly against outliers
(as seen in boxplots) and minimized overfitting due to the ensemble
averaging across multiple trees.

\hypertarget{visual-insights-from-graphs}{%
\subsubsection{Visual Insights from
Graphs}\label{visual-insights-from-graphs}}

Several graphical tools helped validate and interpret the results:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Scatter plots} revealed the linear or nonlinear relationship
  between predictors and inflation.
\item
  \textbf{Boxplots} identified outliers and spread in variables like
  interest rate and oil prices.
\item
  \textbf{Actual vs. Predicted line graphs} helped visualize the
  precision of forecasts for each model.
\item
  \textbf{Feature importance bar plots} (from Random Forest) highlighted
  the dominant variables influencing inflation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusion-2}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-2}}

All three models provided useful insights into the dynamics of
inflation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{ARIMA} captured the temporal structure and autoregressive
  nature of inflation.
\item
  \textbf{SVR} proved effective in modeling nonlinear relationships.
\item
  \textbf{Random Forest} excelled in interpretability and performance,
  particularly in identifying key drivers of inflation.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the analysis suggests that \textbf{money supply (M2)} and
\textbf{time trend (Date)} are the most consistent predictors of
inflation in the dataset, followed by \textbf{unemployment}. These
findings are aligned with macroeconomic theory, where increases in money
supply often fuel inflation unless offset by productivity or labor
market slack.

Future extensions could include testing more variables (e.g., interest
rate, oil prices), expanding the dataset, or applying deep learning
models to improve predictive accuracy.
